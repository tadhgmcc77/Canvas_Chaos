# Canvas_Chaos
Python/Tkinter Mouse-Click Game --> Canvas Chaos


- On pressing the start button, the code will present a small red circle. The user must click this circle. 
- The circle disappears after the user clicks on it. If the user clicks the circle withiin two seconds, they receive 1 point. 
- The circle will then be redrawn at a new location on the canvas, to be clicked for more points. 
- After a player has reached a score of 8, a new object will appear - A blue square. Clicking the blue square will deduct 2 points from the player. 
- After a score of 18 is reached, two new objects are introduced. These objects aim to trick the user into pressing them, as they are red circles, the same colour as the main +1     point red square. Be careful, as clicking on the red circles will cause a 4 point deduction. 
- When the player reaches a score of 28, a special item, the golden snitch, is introduced. The golden snitch is much smaller than the other objects, but is worth 5 points. You'll   have to be quick though, as you must click within 1 second to get the points. 
- When 40 and 50 points are reached, extra instances of earlier objects are introduced, to cause canvas chaos.
